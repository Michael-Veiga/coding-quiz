# Review
Apparently I need alot more practice with javascript because I didnt even get close to completing this application. For the longest time I was stuck on trying to get my answer buttons to populate in my question container. I was finally able to do so, but it stops populating around the third or fourth question. Once I realized that I wasnt going to be able to get the actual quiz to work, I tried to move on to the other aspects of the assignment including the data storage and highscores page, which was incredibly difficult to do since I couldn't actually get the values from any of the quiz options. Pretty much nothing in the scores js and html works since I was trying to throw it in, last minute. I'm definitley going to have to take a step back and revise my studying habits, because this assignment was way over my head.
